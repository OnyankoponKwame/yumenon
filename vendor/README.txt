Place opentype.min.js here to enable outline handwriting.

Recommended:
- opentype.js v1.x (minified) as vendor/opentype.min.js
- A local font file at assets/fonts/Yomogi.woff2 (or .ttf/.otf) and update OUTLINE_FONT_URL in script.js if different.

If either the library or the font is missing, the app gracefully falls back to the SVG reveal mode.
